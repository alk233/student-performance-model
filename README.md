这是一个python数据分析项目
This project predicts final student grades (`G3`) using several machine learning models, including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Decision Tree, and SVR.

Dataset Source: [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance)

 Models Used
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor
- Gradient Boosting Regressor
- Support Vector Regressor (SVR)

Each model was tuned using GridSearchCV and evaluated using MSE and R² metrics.
